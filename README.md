  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Hello! This is a heart dieases identification machine learning model which is deployed to study patient stats and give accurate warnings about being at risk of cardiovascular disease. Millions of people suffer from this, with many more getting diagnosed every year. We plan to make it more easier to keep track of this dangerous disorder so that patients can plan out their future agenda.<p>

  <h3>Dataset</h3>
  <p>The dataset is extracted from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction?datasetId=1582403">Kaggle</a> (click to follow). The dataset currently has 12 attributes: (I-independent, D-dependent)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Age (I)</li>
    <li>Sex (I)</li>
    <li>Chest Pain Type (I)</li>
    <li>Resting Blood Pressure (I)</li>
    <li>Cholestrol (I)</li>
    <li>Fasting Blood Sugar (I)</li>
    <li>Resting ECG (I)</li>
    <li>Max Heart Rate (I)</li>
    <li>Exercise Enigma (I)</li>
    <li>Oldpeak (I)</li></li>
    <li>ST Slope (I)</li>
    <li>Heart Disease(Y(1)/N(0) (D)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Functions to be implemented</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>A fully functional machine learning model that is capable of making highly accurate predictions, not only for the dataset, but also for data being fed from external sources with same parameters.
    <li>A fully functional local site able to perform basic CRUD operations, as well as being able to display pre-existing data and add data to the dataset, asking for user confirmation before asking the user if they want their data to be included for help to others.
  </ol>
